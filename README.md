## 🌟 Welcome to YegnaBudget: A Story of Empowerment and Purpose

Imagine being a university student in Hawassa, juggling classes, social life, and daily expenses — yet unsure where your money goes. Or picture a young adult striving to build better financial habits but lacking the tools to track and reflect. This is where **YegnaBudget** steps in, not just an app, but a companion for conscious living and financial growth.

YegnaBudget is a **Personal Expense Tracker and Financial Literacy App** built with Flutter, designed to help Ethiopian students and young adults manage their daily spending, build awareness, and develop sustainable habits. Created with a deep sense of cultural authenticity and user empathy, it’s more than a tool, it’s a movement toward financial empowerment.

## 📖 The YegnaBudget Story: From Vision to Reality

Every meaningful app begins with a question. For YegnaBudget, it was: *How can I help students like me take control of their finances, and feel proud doing it?*

As a third-year Information Systems student and campus organizer, I saw firsthand how many peers struggled with budgeting. Inspired by the desire to build something practical, personal, and empowering, I began crafting YegnaBudget, not just to ship an MVP, but to master Flutter’s hardest concepts while solving a real problem.

The journey started with sketches and splash screen experiments, evolving through rigorous UI testing, Gradle troubleshooting, and SVG asset refinement. I focused on onboarding flow, mapped icons, and notification logic , ensuring every detail felt intentional and culturally grounded.

From debugging build errors to managing state in the app, this project reflects my commitment to both technical excellence and community impact. Today, on November 20, 2025, YegnaBudget stands as a symbol of student-driven innovation.
